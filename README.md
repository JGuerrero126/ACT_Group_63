# Film-Matic - a Movie and Actor Explorer

This project uses the [TMDB database](https://themoviedb.org) to present descriptions and images for movies and actors.

The project uses a [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) front end and a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based ([Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)) backend.

## Installation

Pull the main branch to your machine.

Get the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) server running first by opening a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) in the `server` directory, installing the Python packages using `pip install flask pymongo dotenv`, then entering `run flask`.

Then get [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) started in development mode. You'll need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Then open a terminal and run `npm install` in the `client` directory. Once that's complete, enter `npm start`. The website should load in your browser.

## Usage

Simply click the links to learn about top-rated movies and actors. First search by genre, then choose a movie to learn more about the movie (description, rating, year released) and its cast. Then click on a cast member to learn more about them and other movies they have appeared in.
