# Movie and Actor Explorer

This project uses the [TMDB database](https://themoviedb.org) to present descriptions and images for movies and actors.

The project uses a [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) front end and a [Python](https://www.python.org/)-based ([Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)) backend.

Get the Flask server running first by opening a virtual environment in the `server` directory, then entering `run flask`.

Then get React started in development mode. You'll need to have node installed. Then open a terminal and run `npm install` in the `client` directory. Once that's complete, enter `npm start`. You should see the website load in your browser.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
